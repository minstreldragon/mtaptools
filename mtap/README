========================================
= Introduction                         =
========================================

   mtap produces .TAP files from Commodore 64 tapes for use with true tape
   emulation on the CCS64 emulator. (Should also work for VIC-20's and older
   Commodore machines' tapes - though no emulator supports those TAPs yet :)

   ************************************************************
   ***  WARNING: NEVER RUN THIS PROGRAM UNDER WINDOWS !!!   ***
   ************************************************************

   REQUIREMENTS:

   - Commodore Datassette recorder or 100% compatible
   - C64S X1541/tape interface adapter or compatible (see links for information
     where to order this)
   - +5 V power supply to adapter (may be obtained from joystick port,
     ideally use a C64's tape interface to obtain the correct voltage)
   - Microsoft DOS and cwsdpmi.exe software


========================================
= Usage                                =
========================================

   From DOS simply type:

   mtap tapname.tap

   The program will record all pulses between pressing <PLAY> on tape
   and <STOP>ping it.


========================================
= History                              =
========================================

   0.10 First version to recorded a working .TAP
   0.12 .TAP header corrections:
        - fill 'future use' field with: 00 00 00 00
        - set filelength entry to correct data length value
        - honor <STOP> event on datassette
   0.13 Improved use of '00' bytes - one 00 byte represents 2550 ticks
   0.14 Again improved '00' bytes timing.
        '00' now represents 1/50 s, this is 2463 ticks
        Print program name and version at startup.
        Set output name extension to "TAP".
	Removed bug which saved huge files when in fact no pulse was recorded.

   to do:
	- support other port choices than LPT1
